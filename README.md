Orginally published in 2004 by McGraw Hill, Digital Design: A Datapath and Control is now
available as an OER.  This text was written for faculty and students wanting a structured
approach to the design of complex digital systems.  It guides students and faculty through
the process by exposing critical skills gradually through the text.

# Features
* End of Chapter Problems.
* Instructorâ€™s Manual containing solutions to the end-of-chapter problems.
* Laboratory Manual containing 11 projects suitable for implementation on many different FPGA development boards.
* Numerous Examples. Many examples demonstrating application of the material are contained throughout the text.


# Why?
You might be asking yourself ``Why bother writing yet another digital design
text?''  While this text does cover many of the same topics you will
find in other digital design texts, it distinguishes itself by
*presenting a systematic design process for sophisticated digital circuits.*
A digital design sophisticated when it needs to be described algorithmically
and has the generic architecture shown in **Figure 1**.

**Figure 1: An abstract digital system constructed from a datapath and a control unit.**


The datapath and control framework classifies the inputs and outputs of every
digital logic building block as either **Data inputs**, **Data output**, **Control**,
**Status** (the two special signals, **clk** and **reset** sit outside this
classification).  Under this framework, the datapath performs all data manipulations and the
control unit sequences the control inputs for datapath.  The datapath is built from
combinational and sequential building blocks like multiplexers and counters.  The control unit
is a finite state machine.

# Class Organization
The text, homework and laboratory are intended for a 4-credit course.  The example timeline
shown in **Table 1** assumes 3 50-minute lectures per week and
one 2 or 3 hour laboratory a week. While it is expected that students finish the laboratory
during the scheduled time, frequently students will need additional time to complete work, so accommodations need
to be in-place for them to access the hardware and software outside of course hours.   I expect that students will
spend about 4-hours a week working outside of class.
